# Customer-KMeans-Clustering
A Python project that applies K-Means Clustering to a retail customer dataset. The dataset contains 20 customers with annual income and spending scores. The project demonstrates clustering, visualization, and interpretation of customer segments.


Steps

Create Dataset: Define a dataset of 20 customers with income and spending scores.

Visualize Data: Plot a scatter plot to understand distribution.

Elbow Method: Determine optimal number of clusters k using WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares).

Train K-Means: Apply K-Means clustering with k=3.

Visualize Clusters: Scatter plot the customers colored by cluster, including cluster centroids.
